              eBay excels in offering expanded dropdown menus, adaptive layout, 
              visual organization, and collaborative filtering. These features 
              contribute to a user-friendly experience by providing easy access 
              to a wide range of options, adapting to different devices, 
              presenting information in an organized manner, and recommending 
              relevant products based on user behavior. TikTok lacks expanded 
              dropdown menus and adaptive layout but compensates with 
              customizable filters (in the form of hashtags), visual 
              organization, and collaborative filtering. While it may not have 
              extensive menu options or a fully responsive design, TikTok allows 
              users to personalize their content preferences, presents videos in 
              an engaging layout, and uses collaborative filtering for tailored 
              recommendations. Simplify Jobs offers expanded dropdown menus, 
              adaptive layout, and collaborative filtering but lacks 
              customizable filters and good visual organization. While it 
              provides options in a structured manner, personalized 
              recommendations, and adjusts to different screen sizes, the 
              absence of customizable filters and visual cues for organization 
              may impact user engagement and satisfaction with the feature.
              <br><br>
              When implementing a list-based interface, I would focus on 
              creating a user-friendly and visually appealing design that 
              enhances usability and engagement. The features and designs I 
              would like to implement based on the successful factors identified 
              and the improvements needed are an adaptive layout, customizable 
              filters (keyword search), visual organization, simplistic and 
              intuitive navigation,  and with enough time, collaborative 
              filtering.

            The intention of this app is to help users find researchers that 
            match their interests. The app will have a list of researchers that 
            users can filter and sort based on their research areas. The app 
            will also have an aggregator that will show favorited researchers 
            that match the user's interests.
            <br><br>
            The app includes a way to filter researcher cards by research area. 
            The user can select a research area from a dropdown menu and the 
            researcher cards will update to show only the researchers that match 
            the selected research area.
            <br><br>
            The app includes a way to filter researcher cards by keywords in the 
            researcher's description. The user can enter a keyword in the search 
            bar and the researcher cards will update to show only the 
            researchers that have the keyword in their description.
            <br><br>
            The app includes a way to sort researcher cards by alphabetical 
            order of the research area. They can be filtered in ascending and 
            descending order.
            <br><br>
            A button at the top of the page allows the user to reset the filters 
            and sorts.
            <br><br>
            Users can add researcher cards to their list of favorites. The 
            aggregator at the right side of the page will update to show the 
            researchers in the list of favorites. Once added to the list of 
            favorites, each researcher has a corresponding button that allows 
            the user to remove the researcher from the list of favorites.
            <br><br>
            Filter & sort are compatible and work in combination with each 
            other. The user can filter by research area and then sort the 
            filtered researchers by alphabetical order of the research area. 
            The user can also filter by keyword and search for descriptions 
            that match the keyword.
